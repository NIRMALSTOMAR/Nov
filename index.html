                    Many customers who have been utilizing organizations with consolidated billing have deployed resources in order to support workloads in their management accounts. If there are any resources in the management account of your organization, then we recommend that you migrate them to a member account within the organization. If the resources cannot be migrated between the accounts without disruption, then we recommend you move the existing management account to a new organization as a member account. This requires a full migration of every AWS account from the existing organization to the new one. The main reason for isolating the management account is to improve your organization security by limiting the management account usage for administrative actions and users only.
